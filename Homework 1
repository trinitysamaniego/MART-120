GUI vs CLI

GUI stands for Graphical User Interface and use computer graphics. It comes with lots of components like icons, search boxes, windows elements and more. There is  more to remember commands due to this. This is great for handling less complex tasks while CLI is designed for more complex tasks. However, GUI is more user friendly to new people trying to code. 
CLI stands for Character Use Interface or Command Line Interface and mostly uses commands that someone inputs as text. This requires less memorization than GUI since there are not many elements. However, this makes it less flexible than GUI since you have to be a bit more precise. This does make CLI more advanced yet powerful over GUI.

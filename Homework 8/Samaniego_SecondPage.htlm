    <h1> A Short Story</h1>
    <p>The wind blew through the black, curly hair of a man standing on the hill. His bandana fluutered in the wind as he stared down at the large hole in the ground. Of course this hole wasn't always here. There was once a thriving city.</p>
    <br />
    <p>He didn't feel anyhting for the once beautiful city since he didn't live there. At least not any sad emotions, however he did feel guilt. The person who cause this huge hole was one of his close friends. How could they cause so much despair and destruction?</p>
    <br />
    <p>For this hole wasn't their only crime. The man had found out his friend had been causing others' in the city despair. Maniulpating them, taking things, and so mcuh more just to have power. He couldn't believe someone so close could do the things he had heard.</p>
    <br />
    <p>"Nick...Nick!"</p>
    <br />
    <p> Nick turned away from the site in front of him to look from where the voice came from. Another man, one he had't talked to much, was standing there. A key hung around the other's neck and shined in the sunlight.</p>
    <br />
    <p>"Yes Warden?", Nick answered after clearing his throat.</p>
    <br />
    <p>"It's time to put Clay in jail for his crimes...we have to escort him. Let's go."
    <br />
    <p> Ah yes...he forgot that was happening so soon. The city had been blown up today, however it felt like that happened days ago. Now he had to go help lock up his close friend.</p>
    <br />
    <p>"Let's go."</p>

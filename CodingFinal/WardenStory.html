    <h1>The Warden</h1>
    <p>Screaming. That's all The Warden heard from down the hallway where the main cell was and his heart dropped. The Warden was frozen until he started his name being screamed from Tommy's voice and he began running. Everything felt like it was in slow motion as he began to arrive to the room on the other side of the main cell.</p>
    <br />
    <p>"SAM! SAM HELP ME!"</p>
    <br />
    <p>Sam couldn't see what was happening since the lava wall was back down. He flipped some levers and put in his keycard to get the lava to start coming down...he shouldn't have left his spot. Sam heard a noise down the hallway and had to make sure it wasn't something trying to mess with the prison. Sam eyes were focused on the lava as he gripped his trident in his hand. He was screaming at Tommy to hold on that he was coming.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Then it was silent...the only sound that could be heard was the bubbling lava flowing down now. When the lava wall was gone the only sight that could be seen was the prisoner standing over Tommy who was laying on the ground. Sam unclipped the strap on his gas mask before covering his mouth...no this sight had to be wrong. Sam had to be dreaming all of this, but it was the sound of the prisoner's laughter that snapped him out of his thoughts.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Sam was screaming and screaming at the prisoner about what had happened and how could the other do this, but all he got back was a laughter. There was no getting any straight answer from that monster...the kid was gone and it happened in his prison. Sam was The Warden of this hell hole after all and whatever happened inside was his problem.</p>

<h3><span style="font-family:Georgia, Garamond, Serif;font-size:large">Welcome To The Stories of People</span></h3>
<p> These are the stories of people you don't know and will never meet. Despite these factors you are still drawn in aren't you? Curious about what these stories have in common and what is that thread that connects them. It's what drives humans to be well...human.</p>
<br />
<p> You're probably asking you I am and how I know these stories. That information is not of importance right now, what is important is that you start your journey down the path of these stories that have been forgotten and untold for a long, long time.</p>

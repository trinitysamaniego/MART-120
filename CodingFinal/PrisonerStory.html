    <h1>The Prisoner</h1>
    <p>How long since it's been since he's seen the light? The natural light...not the light given off by the lava wall blocking his entrance to isolated cell. The lava was a safety precaution to make sure he didn't escape not like he could anyways even if he got past the lava.</p>
    <br />
    <p>This place had more layers of security than any other building in the area and he made sure of it. There were many checkpoints between the entrance and main cell whether that be manual checks from guards or floors moving up from a pit to connect one hallway to another. He had designed something so beautiful only for it to be used against him.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The normal sound of bubbling lava was replaced with the sound of muffled voices...that was new. His eyes landed on the lava wall now as he slowly started to stand up from sitting on the floor. He knew those voices...one was the Warden and the other-</p>
    <br />
    <p>"Tommy..." His voice sounded a bit hoarse since he hadn't spoke since he had gotten locked up in this cage. Only speaking when he needed to and that was mostly with The Warden.</p>
    <br />
    <p>It wasn't long before a barrier towards the lava went up and the lava wall slowly dripped down. His eyes locking onto the iconic white shirt with red sleeves that Tommy always wore and eventually his eyes trailed up to the other's face across the way. Out of all of the people to visit first it had to be the one who got him locked up...the one who caused the most problems for him.</p>
    <br />
    <p>It wasn't long before the platform that stupid kid was standing on began moving towards the cell. Of course he wouldn't be able to move from his side of the cell since the barrier was up not to mention The Warden was just on the other side ready to shut everything down if need be. It wasn't long before Tommy was on the other side of the barrier and it dropped down after the lava wall was back.</p>
    <br />
    <p>There was an awakrward silence as they stood on opposite ends of the cell and eventually it was broken by the blonde haired male.</p>
    <br />
    <p>"Clay...I honestly don't know why I am here right now. Maybe it's to rub it in that I won finally."</p>
    <br />
    <p>They won? No they haven't won...it pissed Clay off that the other thought because in the end he would win this war bewteen them. A low chuckle came from him as he looked at the kid with a smirk.</p>
    <br />
    <p>"Tommy...I'm just going to get out. I will bring him back to help me get out."</p>
    <br />
    <p>A laugh could be heard from Tommy as he began sputtering about a how Clay was a liar about the revive book. The kid never learned to shut up when they needed to always mouthing off and getting themselves into trouble. Clay clenched his fists as anger began to take over at the words the other was sputtering all the male seeing was red now.</p>
    <br />
    <p>"WELL WHY DON'T I SHOW YOU THAT I'M NOT LYING ABOUT THAT BOOK, TOMMY!"</p>

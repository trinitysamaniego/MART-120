      <h1>The Visitor</h1>
      <p>The only sound that could be heard was the crunching of grass beneath a sneaker as footsteps quickly hurried down the path. The sun shining down on the traveler's blonde hair making it shine like a rare golden flower. They seemed to be in a hurry as they walked along the not so worn path since not many people traveled it. Why would they need to get to where this traveler was going?</p>
      <br />
      <p>Why was he even doing this? After finally getting a step forward and locking that monster away for his crimes...why did he feel like he needed to visit? The traveler didn't even realize that they were now standing in front of their destination. A big, stone building with a wide entrance leading inside the waiting area. The traveler stepped inside to wait for someone to come greet him</p>
      <br />
      <p>This building had been hidden from the people who lived here only to be reveled at a time where the person trapped inside it needed it to be. The irony that now that person was the one trapped inside of their own creation and to never leave it. Flashes of memories of the day the monster got put in it's cage began to replay in their mind. That was a day that everyone came together despite their differences and conflicts.</p>
      </br>
      <p>"Tommy? Are you ready to start your visit?"</p>
      <br />
      <p>The rugged voice broke them out of their thoughts as they turned towards it. What greeted them was a very tall, green haired male. Eyes completely black only with a hint of crimson hues staring at them yet despite how intimidating this male was there was a hint of softness to those eyes. Tommy cleared their throat as they broke away from the gaze only to nod as a sigh escaped their lips.</p>
      <br />
      <p>"Ready as I'll ever be, Warden."
